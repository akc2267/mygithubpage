Example, Indeed tells you it has retrieved 3 jobs for you, but you see 8 jobs. I would love to see a way that bypasses HR and get directly to the hiring manager. A person who is eager to get to work can waste hours applying for jobs. I hear HR individuals complain that there are not enough good workers out there, but I think there needs to be a better way that improves this process. It sounds like both sides are frustrated. Perhaps, a more interactive networking job site or a non-profit that organizes networking opportunities for job seekers with opportunities for the job seekers to show their skills. It's much easier to find a job through personal contact with people than it is on-line. Best wishes!</h3>

Since posting my resume there, I get a lot of spam, drive for Uber emails, and "I am a prince from Nambia and I need to move some money, I will pay you 2.3 million dollars for your time if you can help." Many people do not check their "inbox" on indeed- I know our organization used to reach out to applicants through indeed, with no response. I think it is a good system at the end of the day.
