        App for <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/mad/">Mobile App Development</a> at UT Austin.

        <a href="https://invis.io/MF6ZD10TU"> inVision Prototype </a>     
        <br>
        <h3>Purpose:</h3>
        This design is for an app that would allow all members of MAD to stay up to date with events in the organization, to check-in to events, and to keep track of their weekly classes.
        
        <h3>Roles:</h3>
        UX/UI Design - Wire-Framing, Prototyping, Sketching, User Testing
        
        <h3>Requirements, concept, research:</h3>
        I worked with members of MAD to create a list of features the app should have. I researched how MOOC apps (Coursera) were structured and how event based apps were structured (WWDC). The resulting design is a synthesis of those two types of apps.

        <h3>inVision and user testing </h3>
        After I had done a couple of iterations while working with the development team and the design director at MAD, we reached a prototype we felt was close to what we wanted. I tested this prototype with 4 members of MAD at a hacknight. For this testing, I did a cognitive walkthrough that led to some great insights that woule result in this final prototype.
