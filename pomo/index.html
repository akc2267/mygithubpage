        I created this app with my classmate and friend, Nishant Gupta for CS371M Mobile Computing with Emmett Witchel. We wanted to create a music sharing app that would make playing music for roadtrips both collaborative and simple. We wrote the app in such a way that there would be one "master" phone, which would be connected to the car aux cable and also act as a wifi hotspot for other phones to connect to. Then the "slave" phones could send music to the master phone. The combined songs of the master and slave phones would form a playlist on the master phone. If anyone didn't like the current song playing, they could send a skip request to the master phone. If a majority of the people want to skip the current song, the master phone would instantly start playing the next song on the playlist.
        <br><br>
        We implemented a lot of difficult features while building this app. We created a garbage collector to clear out the music sent to the master phone when the app was closed. We also gained a lot of experience understanding wifi sockets and how to send files between devices.
