        This design is the physical embodiment of the Pomodoro technique, a time management technique which uses a timer to break down work into intervals.This video was shot with the help of Aaron Chavez (RTF Major and friend)  
        <br><br>
        This design was made using a SparkFun Inventor's Kit I checked out from the Fine Arts Library. This kit contained the arduino, photoresistor, breadboard, and servo. I made the enclosure from cardboard and used a servo to make the countdown timer mechanical.  
        <br><br>
        In the future, I would like to house the circuit in a wooden box, using the same design vocabulary as other desktop organizers and accessories.  This design was inspired by my desire to have more 3D pieces in my portfolio. I have also been curious about arduino, so this was a great introduction to using one.  
        <br><br>
        I got the idea from the design after becoming frustrated at myself for impulsively checking my phone. The buzzer is abrasive and discourages the impulsive use of a phone.
