   <h2> Vox Usability Study </h2>

    <section id="detail">
      <p>
        This was an assignment for my Interaction Design class in Fall 2015: 
        The assignment was to do a usability analysis of the user interface of a product. This could be either an app or a website.   
        <br><br>
        I chose to do a usability analysis of the Vox site.  I began my analysis by researching general usability heuristics for websites. My work and research was heavily informed by information I found from the Nielson Norman Group's (NNG) site.  
        <br><br>
        For the study I had 6 test subjects. With these subjects I did 3 interviews and 3 cognitive walkthroughs, both of which were conducted according to the guidelines set out by NNG. This analysis of the site made me a more critical observer of how this site was designed and has informed my design process for user interfaces.   
        <br><br>
        I think that a combination of research and allowing design choices to be informed by user research can certainly create more effective and usable designs.
